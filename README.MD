[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/rubemlrm/go-shelly/graph/badge.svg?token=KMFD7E3XGG)](https://codecov.io/github/rubemlrm/go-shelly)

The main objective for this project is to provide a native go client that supports Gen1 and Gen2 plus.



# Notes

The client implementation that supports the http requests is heavyly inspired by the implementation that [Google](https://github.com/google) team done with [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) project and [xanzy](https://github.com/xanzy) [go-gitlab](https://github.com/xanzy/go-gitlab) project. Both projects have a great implementation and testing coverage. Thank both of the projects to share your knowledge with the open source community.
